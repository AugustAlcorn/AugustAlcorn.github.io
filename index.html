        <p>Hello! I'm August Alcorn, 
            a non-binary individual who uses 
            they/them pronouns. I was born on 
            December 19, 1995, and I'm currently 
            a student at Mid Michigan College. I 
            have a passion for video games, particularly 
            in genres like open-world, survival, MMO, 
            racing, and FPS. The GTA franchise holds a 
            special place in my heart as my favorite series. 
            Outside of gaming, I'm interested in 
            cybersecurity and am in the process of learning 
            to code. My fiance is Amanda Adkins, and my 
            favorite color is a dark, unsaturated purple, 
            similar to plum.</p>
